            <h1>Artificial Intelligence Robots And The Future Of Work</h1>
            <p>The number of robots in the world today is approaching 1,000,000, with almost half that number in Japan and just 15% in the US.
                 A couple of decades ago, 90% of robots were used in car manufacturing, typically on assembly lines doing a variety of repetitive tasks.
                  Today only 50% are in automobile plants, with the other half spread out among other factories, and many other industries.
